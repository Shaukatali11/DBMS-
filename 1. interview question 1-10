Q1. What is a DBMS?
Answer: A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that provides an interface to interact with databases for storing, retrieving, and managing data. It allows users to 
create, read, update, and delete data in a systematic and controlled manner.

Q2. What are the different types of DBMS?
Answer: The different types of DBMS are:
- Hierarchical DBMS
- Network DBMS
- Relational DBMS (RDBMS)
- Object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS)

Q3. What is a primary key?
Answer: A primary key is a unique identifier for a database record. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULLs. Each table can have only one primary key.

Q4. What is a foreign key?
Answer: A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that uniquely identifies a row of another table or the same table. The foreign key is defined in a 
second table, but it refers to the primary key or a unique key in the first table.

Q5. What is SQL?
Answer: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It includes commands for querying data, 
updating data, and managing database structures.

Q6. What are the different types of SQL commands?
Answer: The different types of SQL commands are:
DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP
DML (Data Manipulation Language): SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE
TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

Q7. What is a join in SQL?
Answer: A join is an SQL operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, 
and FULL OUTER JOIN.

Q8. What is normalization?
Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and
defining relationships between them.

Q9. What are the different normal forms?
Answer: The different normal forms are:
First Normal Form (1NF)
Second Normal Form (2NF)
Third Normal Form (3NF)
Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

Q10. What is denormalization?
Answer: Denormalization is the process of combining normalized tables to improve read performance by reducing the number of joins. It is often used in data warehousing and 
OLAP systems.
