Q1. What is an index in SQL?
Answer: An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional writes and storage space. Indexes can be 
created on one or more columns of a table.

Q2. What is a transaction?
Answer: A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions are used to ensure data integrity and consistency. 
They follow the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

Q3. What are the ACID properties?
Answer: The ACID properties are:
Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully; otherwise, the transaction is aborted.
Consistency: Ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
Isolation: Ensures that transactions are isolated from each other, preventing concurrent transactions from interfering.
Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure.

Q4. What is a view in SQL?
Answer: A view is a virtual table in SQL, created by a query that selects data from one or more tables. Views simplify complex queries, enhance security by restricting access
to specific data, and provide a level of abstraction.

Q5. What is a stored procedure?
Answer: A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be stored and executed on the database server. Stored procedures help in code reuse, encapsulation, and improving 
performance by reducing network traffic.

Q6. What is a trigger in SQL?
Answer: A trigger is a special kind of stored procedure that automatically executes in response to certain events on a table or view, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations. 
Triggers are used to enforce business rules, audit changes, and maintain integrity.

Q7. What is a cursor in SQL?
Answer: A cursor is a database object used to retrieve, manipulate, and navigate through a result set row by row. Cursors are used in stored procedures and triggers to handle
data on a per-row basis.

Q8. What is a database schema?
Answer: A database schema is the structure that defines the organization of data in a database, including tables, views, indexes, and relationships. It provides a blueprint of
how data is stored and managed.

Q9. What is a composite key?
Answer: A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns in a table. The combination of these columns uniquely identifies each row in the table.

Q10. What is a subquery in SQL?
Answer: A subquery is a query nested inside another query. Subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to retrieve data that will be used in the 
main query.
